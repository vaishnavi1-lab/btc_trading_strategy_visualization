# btc_trading_strategy_visualization
This repository contains code to visualize Bitcoin (BTC) price movements along with randomly generated buy and sell signals based on a hypothetical trading strategy. The code loads BTC price data, generates random buy/sell/none signals, and plots the BTC price with highlighted buy and sell signals on a time series chart.
